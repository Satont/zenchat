## Context

### Original Request

User sees ~400MB RSS in `htop` on Linux with 1 platform + 1 channel active, stable from startup (~1 min). Electrobun promises low memory, 400MB feels alarming.

### Interview Summary

**Key Discussions**:

- **Measurement**: `htop` RES column on Linux — includes shared library pages (CEF/Chromium Embedded Framework, libc, etc.) charged to the process but physically shared with other apps
- **Profile**: Stable at startup, not growing — rules out runaway leak; points to high baseline + fixable bugs
- **Scale**: 1 platform, 1 channel — no multi-platform amplification

**Research Findings**:

- **CEF baseline**: On Linux, the desktop app uses CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework), configured in `packages/desktop/electrobun.config.ts` (`bundleCEF: true`, `defaultRenderer: 'cef'`). CEF contributes ~150–300MB to htop RES as shared Chromium pages. These are **not reducible** without changing the rendering engine. The actual private app memory is measured via `/proc/$PID/smaps` (USS: `Private_Clean + Private_Dirty`)
- **Real bugs found**: 6 confirmed issues in adapters and Vue renderer (see tasks)
- **Misdiagnosis corrected**: `mentionColorCache` in `ChatMessage.vue` was the old location; after frontend rewrite, it lives in `useMessageParsing.ts` (module-scoped composable). The real problems are unchanged: unnecessary `reactive()` wrapper overhead and unbounded Map growth.

- **Frontend rewrite**: Frontend was fully rewritten after this plan was first created. Key changes relevant to this plan:
  - `mentionColorCache` moved from `ChatMessage.vue` to `useMessageParsing.ts` (module-scoped composable)
  - `ChatList.vue` already uses `usePolling` composable for channel status polling — Task 7 is already done, removed from plan
  - `App.vue` now imports Pinia stores (`useAccountsStore`, `useSettingsStore`, `useChannelStatusStore`) — Pinia is used in the project but the `messages`/`events`/`watchedMessages` reactive state in App.vue still uses raw `ref`, not Pinia
  - O(n) spread patterns in `messages`/`events`/`watchedMessages` listeners are still present

- Bug #1 diagnosis was wrong — `mentionColorCache` IS module-scoped; corrected framing in Task 5
- `TwitchAdapter.badgeRefreshInterval` is already handled by `clearTimers()` — removed from plan
- Task 0 (baseline measurement) was missing — added as mandatory first task
- `watchedMessages` Map clone in `App.vue` was missed — added to Task 6
- `virtua` reverse vs. template `reverse()` conflict — resolved: use `virtua`'s `reverse` prop, remove template `.reverse()`
- Unbounded `mentionColorCache` growth (not just `reactive()` overhead) — addressed in Task 5

## Work Objectives

### Core Objective

Fix confirmed memory bugs and excessive allocations. Provide a measured before/after comparison. Calibrate user expectations about CEF's (Chromium Embedded Framework) inherent shared-memory footprint on Linux.

### Concrete Deliverables

- `.sisyphus/evidence/memory-baseline.txt` — pre-fix private RSS
- `.sisyphus/evidence/memory-after.txt` — post-fix private RSS
- `packages/desktop/src/platforms/youtube/adapter.ts` — reconnect timer fix
- `packages/desktop/src/platforms/kick/adapter.ts` — WebSocket teardown fix
- `packages/desktop/src/platforms/twitch/adapter.ts` — double-connect guard
- `packages/desktop/src/views/main/composables/useMessageParsing.ts` — cache optimization (was ChatMessage.vue in old plan)
- `packages/desktop/src/views/main/App.vue` — buffer allocation optimization
- `packages/desktop/src/views/main/components/ChatList.vue` — virtua integration

### Definition of Done

- [ ] `bun run check` passes (typecheck + lint + format)
- [ ] `bun test tests/` passes (all existing tests green)
- [ ] USS (private RSS) measured before and after — delta documented
- [ ] Chat renders correctly: badges, emotes, mentions, auto-scroll
- [ ] All QA scenarios in tasks pass with captured evidence

### Must Have

- Baseline private RSS measured BEFORE any code changes
- All 6 confirmed bugs fixed
- `virtua` used for virtual scrolling (specifically, not `vue-virtual-scroller` or `@tanstack/virtual`)
- Auto-scroll behavior preserved after virtua integration
- Final measurement documents CEF shared-page explanation

### Must NOT Have (Guardrails)

- DO NOT migrate `messages`, `events`, or `watchedMessages` refs in App.vue to Pinia — in-place mutation is sufficient (Pinia is already used for accounts/settings/channelStatus, but these message buffers should stay as raw refs)
- DO NOT add virtual scrolling to watched-channels view or EventsFeed — only `ChatList.vue`
- DO NOT add `@vue/test-utils` or a component test harness
- DO NOT introduce LRU cache library — simple `.size > 2000 → .clear()` is sufficient
- DO NOT fix `TwitchAdapter.badgeRefreshInterval` — already correctly implemented via `clearTimers()`
- DO NOT refactor `base-adapter.ts` or the watched-channels manager architecture
- DO NOT use `vue-virtual-scroller` — has known issues with variable heights and bottom-anchored scroll
- DO NOT add new lint exceptions or `@ts-ignore` anywhere
- DO NOT create `useChannelStatuses.ts` composable — `usePolling` already exists and ChatList already uses it

---

## Verification Strategy

> **ZERO HUMAN INTERVENTION** — ALL verification is agent-executed. No exceptions.

### Test Decision

- **Infrastructure exists**: YES (`bun test tests/`)
- **Automated tests**: None new (existing tests must stay green)
- **Framework**: `bun test`
- **Rationale**: These are bug fixes and perf optimizations; existing tests verify correctness. No component DOM test harness exists.

### QA Policy

Every task includes agent-executed QA scenarios. Evidence saved to `.sisyphus/evidence/`.

- **Measurement tasks**: Bash — `/proc/$PID/smaps` + `grep VmRSS /proc/$PID/status`
- **Adapter fixes**: Bash (bun script) — instantiate adapter, trigger reconnect paths, verify single active connection
- **Vue renderer fixes**: Playwright — open app, send messages, verify DOM node counts + scroll behavior
- **Virtua integration**: Playwright — verify visible node count < 30, verify auto-scroll behavior

## TODOs

- [x] 1. Measure baseline private RSS before any code changes

  **What to do**:
  - Start the desktop app with BOTH Vite and Electrobun running in parallel:
    ```bash
    bun run --cwd packages/desktop dev
    ```
    This runs `bun run --parallel hmr start` which spawns Vite (port 5173) AND `bun src/bun/index.ts` (which sets `process.title = 'TwirChat'`) simultaneously. Wait for both to be ready (~15 seconds).
  - Take **two measurements** to cover both idle and loaded states:
    1. **Idle measurement** (after app starts, before any messages): wait 30 seconds
    2. **Loaded measurement** (after injecting 150 messages via seed script): run `bun packages/desktop/tests/fixtures/seed-chat.ts` then wait 30 more seconds
  - IMPORTANT: The seed script (`tests/fixtures/seed-chat.ts`) does NOT exist yet in this task — this task only creates the **idle** baseline. The full 2-part measurement is finalized in F4. For this task, capture the **idle** baseline only.
  - Run the measurement commands below and save output to `.sisyphus/evidence/memory-baseline.txt`

  **Must NOT do**:
  - Do NOT modify any source files in this task
  - Do NOT start any code changes before this task is complete and baseline is recorded
  - Do NOT use `bun run --cwd packages/desktop start` — this runs `electrobun dev` without Vite, which leaves the main window blank

  **Recommended Agent Profile**:
  - **Category**: `quick`
    - Reason: Single bash script execution, zero code changes
  - **Skills**: []

  **Parallelization**:
  - **Can Run In Parallel**: NO
  - **Parallel Group**: Wave 0 — must complete before any code changes
  - **Blocks**: All tasks 2–8 (code changes must not start until baseline is captured)
  - **Blocked By**: None (can start immediately)

  **References**:
  - `packages/desktop/src/bun/index.ts` — sets `process.title = 'TwirChat'`; spawned as part of `dev` script
  - `packages/desktop/package.json` — `"dev": "bun run --parallel hmr start"`, `"hmr:main": "vite --config vite.main.config.ts --port 5173"`, `"start": "bun src/bun/index.ts"`

  **Acceptance Criteria**:

  **QA Scenarios (MANDATORY)**:

  ```
  Scenario: Record baseline idle private RSS
    Tool: Bash
    Preconditions: App started via 'bun run --cwd packages/desktop dev', both Vite and bun process running, 30+ seconds elapsed
    Steps:
      1. PID=$(pgrep TwirChat)
         # Fallback if empty: PID=$(pgrep -f "src/bun/index.ts" | tr '\n' ' ' | awk '{print $1}')
      2. echo "=== Date: $(date) ===" > .sisyphus/evidence/memory-baseline.txt
      3. echo "=== htop RES (VmRSS) ===" >> .sisyphus/evidence/memory-baseline.txt
      4. grep VmRSS /proc/$PID/status >> .sisyphus/evidence/memory-baseline.txt
      5. echo "=== Idle Private RSS (USS = Private_Clean + Private_Dirty) ===" >> .sisyphus/evidence/memory-baseline.txt
      6. awk '/Private_Clean|Private_Dirty/{sum+=$2} END{print "USS:", sum/1024, "MB"}' /proc/$PID/smaps >> .sisyphus/evidence/memory-baseline.txt
      7. cat .sisyphus/evidence/memory-baseline.txt
    Expected Result: File has VmRSS line (e.g. "VmRSS: 400000 kB") and USS line (e.g. "USS: 95 MB")
    Failure Indicators: PID not found (app not running), smaps unreadable
    Evidence: .sisyphus/evidence/memory-baseline.txt
  ```

  **Evidence to Capture**:
  - [ ] `.sisyphus/evidence/memory-baseline.txt` — must contain VmRSS and USS values (idle baseline)

  **Commit**: NO — no code changes in this task

- [x] 2. Fix YouTube adapter reconnect timer stacking

  **What to do**:
  - File: `packages/desktop/src/platforms/youtube/adapter.ts`
  - In `scheduleReconnect()`: add `if (this.reconnectTimeout) { clearTimeout(this.reconnectTimeout); this.reconnectTimeout = null }` BEFORE the line `this.reconnectTimeout = setTimeout(...)`
  - This ensures that if `scheduleReconnect()` is called multiple times in quick succession (both `error` and `end` events firing, or rapid failures), only ONE timer is pending at a time
  - Run `bun run fix` from the **monorepo root** (`/home/satont/Projects/twirchat`) after the change

  **Must NOT do**:
  - Do NOT refactor the broader reconnect logic or `tryConnect()` method
  - Do NOT change reconnect delay math or `reconnectAttempts` logic
  - Do NOT touch any other methods in the file

  **Recommended Agent Profile**:
  - **Category**: `quick`
    - Reason: Single-file, 2-line surgical fix
  - **Skills**: []

  **Parallelization**:
  - **Can Run In Parallel**: YES
  - **Parallel Group**: Wave 1 (with Tasks 3 and 4)
  - **Blocks**: F1–F4
  - **Blocked By**: Task 1 (baseline must be recorded first)

  **References**:

  **Pattern References**:
  - `packages/desktop/src/platforms/youtube/adapter.ts` — look for `scheduleReconnect()` method; find the `this.reconnectTimeout = setTimeout(...)` line and add the clearTimeout guard immediately before it
  - Look for `this.reconnectTimeout` field — it's already typed (likely `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null`)

  **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] `bun run check` passes (from monorepo root) and `bun run --cwd packages/desktop typecheck` passes

  **QA Scenarios (MANDATORY)**:

  ```
  Scenario: scheduleReconnect called twice does not stack timers
    Tool: Bash (bun eval)
    Preconditions: YouTube adapter class importable
    Steps:
      1. In packages/desktop: bun -e "
           const { YouTubeAdapter } = await import('./src/platforms/youtube/adapter.ts');
           const a = new YouTubeAdapter();
           a['shouldReconnect'] = true;
           a['scheduleReconnect']();
           const t1 = a['reconnectTimeout'];
           a['scheduleReconnect']();
           const t2 = a['reconnectTimeout'];
           console.log('timers differ:', t1 !== t2);
           console.log('t1 cleared:', t1 !== null);
           clearTimeout(t2);
         "
      2. Assert output: 'timers differ: true' (new timer replaced old)
    Expected Result: Only 1 timeout pending; old one cleared before new one set
    Failure Indicators: Two active timers, or timeout references are identical
    Evidence: .sisyphus/evidence/task-2-youtube-timer.txt

  Scenario: Rapid reconnect failures don't stack
    Tool: Bash
    Preconditions: Code change applied
    Steps:
      1. grep -n "clearTimeout\|reconnectTimeout" packages/desktop/src/platforms/youtube/adapter.ts
      2. Assert: clearTimeout line appears BEFORE the setTimeout line in scheduleReconnect()
    Expected Result: clearTimeout guard present in scheduleReconnect()
    Failure Indicators: No clearTimeout call in scheduleReconnect
    Evidence: .sisyphus/evidence/task-2-youtube-grep.txt
  ```

  **Evidence to Capture**:
  - [ ] `.sisyphus/evidence/task-2-youtube-grep.txt`

  **Commit**: YES
  - Message: `fix(youtube-adapter): clear reconnectTimeout before scheduling new one`
  - Files: `packages/desktop/src/platforms/youtube/adapter.ts`
  - Pre-commit: `bun run fix` (monorepo root) + `bun run --cwd packages/desktop typecheck`

- [x] 3. Fix Kick adapter orphaned WebSocket on re-connect

  **What to do**:
  - File: `packages/desktop/src/platforms/kick/adapter.ts`
  - In `connectPusher()`: at the very beginning of the method body, BEFORE creating a new `WebSocket`, add:
    ```typescript
    if (this.ws) {
      this.ws.close()
      this.ws = null
    }
    ```
  - This ensures calling `connect()` a second time (for a different channel or after an error) does not orphan the old Pusher WebSocket
  - Run `bun run fix` from the **monorepo root** after the change

  **Must NOT do**:
  - Do NOT touch the reconnect logic (`shouldReconnect`, `connectPusher` retry path)
  - Do NOT change event handlers or Pusher protocol logic
  - Do NOT touch any other methods

  **Recommended Agent Profile**:
  - **Category**: `quick`
    - Reason: Single-file, 3-line surgical fix
  - **Skills**: []

  **Parallelization**:
  - **Can Run In Parallel**: YES
  - **Parallel Group**: Wave 1 (with Tasks 2 and 4)
  - **Blocks**: F1–F4
  - **Blocked By**: Task 1

  **References**:

  **Pattern References**:
  - `packages/desktop/src/platforms/kick/adapter.ts` — find `connectPusher()` method; find where `new WebSocket(wsUrl)` is called; add teardown immediately before it
  - `packages/desktop/src/platforms/youtube/adapter.ts` — check the `disconnect()` method for the teardown pattern to mirror

  **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] `bun run check` passes (monorepo root) and `bun run --cwd packages/desktop typecheck` passes

  **QA Scenarios (MANDATORY)**:

  ```
  Scenario: connectPusher tears down old WS before creating new one
    Tool: Bash
    Preconditions: Code change applied
    Steps:
      1. grep -n "this.ws.close\|this.ws = null\|new WebSocket" packages/desktop/src/platforms/kick/adapter.ts
      2. Assert: ws.close() and ws = null appear BEFORE new WebSocket() in connectPusher()
    Expected Result: teardown guard present before new WebSocket
    Failure Indicators: new WebSocket() appears before ws.close()
    Evidence: .sisyphus/evidence/task-3-kick-grep.txt

  Scenario: re-connect does not orphan old socket
    Tool: Bash (bun eval)
    Preconditions: KickAdapter importable
    Steps:
      1. bun -e "
           const { KickAdapter } = await import('./src/platforms/kick/adapter.ts');
           const a = new KickAdapter();
           // Manually set a fake closed WS to simulate prior connect
           const fakeWs = { close: () => console.log('old WS closed'), readyState: 1 };
           a['ws'] = fakeWs;
           // Verify teardown is invoked when connectPusher starts
           // (can't easily test without network, just verify the guard code path)
           console.log('ws before:', a['ws'] !== null);
         "
    Expected Result: Teardown code present; verified via grep
    Evidence: .sisyphus/evidence/task-3-kick-eval.txt
  ```

  **Evidence to Capture**:
  - [ ] `.sisyphus/evidence/task-3-kick-grep.txt`

  **Commit**: YES
  - Message: `fix(kick-adapter): close existing WebSocket before creating new connection`
  - Files: `packages/desktop/src/platforms/kick/adapter.ts`
  - Pre-commit: `bun run fix` (monorepo root) + `bun run --cwd packages/desktop typecheck`

- [x] 4. Fix Twitch adapter double-connect guard in connectChatClient()

  **What to do**:
  - File: `packages/desktop/src/platforms/twitch/adapter.ts`
  - In `connectChatClient()` (or at the start of `connect()` before `connectChatClient()` is called): add a guard to quit and clear any existing `chatClient` before creating a new one:
    ```typescript
    if (this.chatClient) {
      try {
        await this.chatClient.quit()
      } catch {
        // ignore errors from already-closed client
      }
      this.chatClient = null
    }
    ```
  - Place this BEFORE `this.chatClient = new ChatClient({...})` inside `connectChatClient()`
  - This prevents two simultaneous Twurple `ChatClient` IRC connections when `connectChatClient()` is called while one is already active (possible in reconnect paths or if `connect()` called twice)
  - Run `bun run fix` from the **monorepo root** after the change

  **Must NOT do**:
  - Do NOT touch `clearTimers()` or `badgeRefreshInterval` — already correctly handled
  - Do NOT refactor event handler setup (`setupEventHandlers`)
  - Do NOT change `disconnect()` logic

  **Recommended Agent Profile**:
  - **Category**: `quick`
    - Reason: Single-file, surgical fix, established pattern
  - **Skills**: []

  **Parallelization**:
  - **Can Run In Parallel**: YES
  - **Parallel Group**: Wave 1 (with Tasks 2 and 3)
  - **Blocks**: F1–F4
  - **Blocked By**: Task 1

  **References**:

  **Pattern References**:
  - `packages/desktop/src/platforms/twitch/adapter.ts` — find `connectChatClient()` and locate `this.chatClient = new ChatClient({...})`; insert the quit guard before it
  - Check the return type of `chatClient.quit()` — it may return a Promise; use `await`
  - `packages/desktop/src/platforms/kick/adapter.ts` (after Task 3) — similar teardown pattern

  **API References**:
  - Twurple `ChatClient.quit()` — gracefully closes the IRC connection. Returns Promise<void>. Safe to call even if client is in error state (wrap in try/catch).

  **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] `bun run check` passes (monorepo root) and `bun run --cwd packages/desktop typecheck` passes

  **QA Scenarios (MANDATORY)**:

  ```
  Scenario: connectChatClient guard prevents double-connect
    Tool: Bash
    Preconditions: Code change applied
    Steps:
      1. grep -n "chatClient.quit\|this.chatClient = null\|new ChatClient" packages/desktop/src/platforms/twitch/adapter.ts
      2. Assert: quit() and null assignment appear BEFORE new ChatClient() in connectChatClient()
    Expected Result: Guard present before new ChatClient instantiation
    Failure Indicators: new ChatClient() appears before quit guard
    Evidence: .sisyphus/evidence/task-4-twitch-grep.txt

  Scenario: Graceful handling when chatClient.quit() throws
    Tool: Bash
    Preconditions: Code change applied
    Steps:
      1. Verify try/catch wraps the quit() call:
         grep -A5 "chatClient.quit" packages/desktop/src/platforms/twitch/adapter.ts
      2. Assert: catch block is present (empty catch or logs are acceptable)
    Expected Result: try { await quit() } catch { } pattern visible

- [x] 5. useMessageParsing.ts — remove reactive() from mentionColorCache, add 2000-entry size cap

  **What to do**:
  - File: `packages/desktop/src/views/main/composables/useMessageParsing.ts`
  - Find the module-level declaration (at the top, before the exported function):
    ```typescript
    const mentionColorCache = reactive(new Map<string, string | null>())
    ```
  - Change it to a plain Map:
    ```typescript
    const mentionColorCache = new Map<string, string | null>()
    ```
  - In `fetchMentionColor()`, add a size guard BEFORE the `mentionColorCache.set(...)` calls (there are two: one in the try, one in the catch). Add the guard before the first `set()` in the try:
    ```typescript
    if (mentionColorCache.size > 2000) {
      mentionColorCache.clear()
    }
    ```
  - CRITICAL: After removing `reactive()`, verify `highlightMentions()` still works. `highlightMentions` calls `mentionColorCache.get(key)` directly. Since this is inside a `computed()` in `useMessageParsing()`, Vue tracks reactive dependencies — but a plain Map won't trigger recompute. However, the flow is: `highlightMentions` → fires `fetchMentionColor` async → on next message render cycle the updated cache is read. The computed in `useMessageParsing` is `messageParts` which is recomputed when `message` changes (via prop reactivity), not when the cache changes. So removing `reactive()` is safe here: mention colors are populated async, and the mention span is re-rendered via `processText()` which is called freshly on next render triggered by message changes. No reactivity is lost.
  - Run `bun run fix` from the **monorepo root** (`/home/satont/Projects/twirchat`) after the change

  **Must NOT do**:
  - Do NOT introduce an LRU cache library
  - Do NOT change the cache key format (`${platform}:${username.toLowerCase()}`) or lookup logic
  - Do NOT touch mention regex or `highlightMentions` logic beyond what's needed
  - Do NOT touch `ChatMessage.vue` — `mentionColorCache` is no longer in that file

  - **Category**: `quick`
    - Reason: Single-file, small change with one gotcha to verify
  - **Skills**: []

  **Parallelization**:
  - **Can Run In Parallel**: YES
  - **Parallel Group**: Wave 2 (with Task 6)

- [x] 6. App.vue — eliminate O(n) array/Map allocations on every incoming message

  **What to do**:
  - File: `packages/desktop/src/views/main/App.vue`

  **Change 1 — `messages` buffer** (line ~267, in `useRpcListener('chat_message', ...)`):

  ```typescript
  // BEFORE:
  messages.value = [msg, ...messages.value].slice(0, 500)

  // AFTER — in-place mutation (Vue 3 Proxy tracks array mutations):
  messages.value.unshift(msg)
  if (messages.value.length > 500) messages.value.length = 500
  ```

  **Change 2 — `events` buffer** (line ~271, in `useRpcListener('chat_event', ...)`):

  ```typescript
  // BEFORE:
  events.value = [ev, ...events.value].slice(0, 200)

  // AFTER:
  events.value.unshift(ev)
  if (events.value.length > 200) events.value.length = 200
  ```

  **Change 3 — `watchedMessages` Map** (lines ~335–340, in `useRpcListener('watched_channel_message', ...)`):

  ```typescript
  // BEFORE:
  const prev = watchedMessages.value.get(channelId) ?? []
  watchedMessages.value = new Map(watchedMessages.value).set(
    channelId,
    [message, ...prev].slice(0, 200),
  )

  // AFTER — mutate the existing Map, trigger reactivity explicitly:
  const prev = watchedMessages.value.get(channelId) ?? []
  prev.unshift(message)
  if (prev.length > 200) prev.length = 200
  watchedMessages.value.set(channelId, prev)
  triggerRef(watchedMessages)
  ```

  Import `triggerRef` from `'vue'` — add it to the existing `import { computed, onMounted, ref } from 'vue'` line.
  - Run `bun run fix` from the **monorepo root** (`/home/satont/Projects/twirchat`) after all 3 changes

  **Must NOT do**:
  - Do NOT migrate `messages`, `events`, or `watchedMessages` to Pinia (Pinia is already used for accounts/settings/channelStatus, but these message buffers should remain raw refs in App.vue)
  - Do NOT change the 500/200 message caps
  - Do NOT change the data shape of `NormalizedChatMessage` or `NormalizedEvent`

  **Recommended Agent Profile**:

- [x] 7. ChatList.vue — integrate virtua VList for DOM virtualization

  **What to do**:

  **Step 1: Install virtua**

  ```bash
  cd packages/desktop && bun add virtua
  ```

  **Step 2: Replace the v-for render block in ChatList.vue**

  Find the current render block:

  ```vue
  <ChatMessage v-for="msg in [...activeMessages].reverse()" :key="msg.id" :message="..." />
  ```

  (It may be wrapped in a container div)

  Replace with virtua's `VList` component:

  ```vue
  <script setup lang="ts">
  import { VList } from 'virtua/vue'
  // ... other imports
  </script>

  <template>
    <!-- Replace the messages container with: -->
    <VList :data="activeMessages" :reverse="true" class="messages">
      <template #default="{ item }">
        <ChatMessage :key="item.id" :message="item" />
      </template>
    </VList>
  </template>
  ```

  **CRITICAL — resolve the reverse conflict**:
  - The old template does `[...activeMessages].reverse()` — this creates a reversed copy on every render
  - With virtua `VList`, pass `activeMessages` directly (no `.reverse()`) and use the `:reverse="true"` prop
  - VList's `reverse` prop renders bottom-anchored (newest messages at bottom, user can scroll up)
  - Remove `[...activeMessages].reverse()` — pass `activeMessages` directly to `:data`
  - Read ChatList.vue CSS before making changes: if the container uses `flex-direction: column-reverse` or similar CSS scroll tricks, remove them — virtua handles bottom-anchoring via the `reverse` prop internally
  - Check for `useChatScroll` composable usage in ChatList.vue — if it manually sets `scrollTop`, it may conflict with virtua's built-in scroll management. Read `useChatScroll.ts` carefully before the change.

  **Step 3: Verify scroll behavior**
  - virtua with `:reverse="true"` auto-anchors scroll to the bottom when new items are added
  - If `useChatScroll.ts` does manual `scrollTop` manipulation, it will conflict. If so, check whether virtua exposes a ref/API for the scroll container; either adapt `useChatScroll` to use virtua's API or disable the composable's scroll manipulation for the virtua-rendered list

  **Step 4: Run `bun run fix` from monorepo root** + `bun run --cwd packages/desktop typecheck`

  **Step 5: Create a Playwright-testable test harness for virtua verification**

  `packages/desktop/src/views/main/main.ts` blocks Vue mounting until Electrobun's `bunSocket` is open, which never happens in a plain browser (Playwright). To allow Playwright-based verification of VList rendering without modifying production code:

  Create `packages/desktop/src/views/main/test-harness.html` and `packages/desktop/src/views/main/test-harness.ts` — a self-contained minimal Vue page that mounts ChatList directly with 200 seed messages, served by the Vite dev server on a separate URL. This does NOT require Electrobun RPC and does NOT need `waitForSocket`.

  ```html
  <!-- packages/desktop/src/views/main/test-harness.html -->
  <!doctype html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <title>Test Harness</title>
    </head>
    <body style="margin:0;height:100vh;display:flex;flex-direction:column">
      <div id="harness" style="flex:1;overflow:hidden"></div>
      <script type="module" src="./test-harness.ts"></script>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

  **IMPORTANT**: Read `packages/shared/types.ts` and `ChatList.vue`'s props interface before writing `test-harness.ts` to get exact field names and prop names. Also read `useChatScroll.ts` to understand if it depends on a specific DOM structure that the harness must replicate. Match all exactly.

  **Step 6: Add dev-only message injection endpoint in `src/bun/index.ts`**

  `bun/index.ts` currently has NO `Bun.serve()` call — it uses only Electrobun APIs. Add a NEW `Bun.serve()` block, gated by a dev env check, on port **45824**:

  ```typescript
  // DEV-ONLY: HTTP endpoint for test message injection
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    Bun.serve({
      port: 45824,
      async fetch(req) {
        const url = new URL(req.url)
        if (url.pathname === '/dev/inject-chat' && req.method === 'POST') {
          const body = (await req.json()) as NormalizedChatMessage
          sendToView.chat_message(body)
          return new Response('ok')
        }
        return new Response('not found', { status: 404 })
      },
    })
  }
  ```

  Read `packages/desktop/src/bun/index.ts` to find:
  - The exact variable name for the WebviewSender cast (search for `as unknown as WebviewSender`) — use that variable in place of `sendToView`
  - The import path for `NormalizedChatMessage`
  - Add this block AFTER the `BrowserWindow` and RPC setup (so the sender variable is already defined)

  **Step 7: Create `packages/desktop/tests/fixtures/seed-chat.ts`**

  This script sends 150 fake messages via the test endpoint. Read `packages/shared/types.ts` for the exact `NormalizedChatMessage` field names before writing it — match all fields exactly.

  **Must NOT do**:
  - Do NOT use `vue-virtual-scroller` — use only `virtua`
  - Do NOT apply virtua to WatchedChannelsView or EventsFeed
  - Do NOT add `height` or `width` CSS constraints that break the existing layout
  - Do NOT change the `NormalizedChatMessage` type or `ChatMessage.vue` component interface

  **Recommended Agent Profile**:
  - **Category**: `unspecified-high`
    - Reason: Significant UI change; scroll anchor behavior must be verified; library integration requires reading existing CSS layout and composable interaction
  - **Skills**: []

  **Parallelization**:
  - **Can Run In Parallel**: NO
  - **Parallel Group**: Wave 3 — sequential after Wave 2 (depends on clean ChatList from Tasks 5–6)
  - **Blocks**: F1–F4
  - **Blocked By**: Tasks 5, 6

  **References**:

  **Pattern References**:
  - `packages/desktop/src/views/main/components/ChatList.vue` — read in full before changes: find the messages container CSS, existing scroll logic, `useChatScroll` composable usage, and the full v-for block
  - `packages/desktop/src/views/main/composables/useChatScroll.ts` — read in full; understand if it does manual `scrollTop` manipulation that would conflict with virtua's `reverse` prop
  - `packages/desktop/src/bun/index.ts` — find the WebviewSender variable name (search `as unknown as WebviewSender`)

  **External References**:
  - virtua Vue 3 docs: https://github.com/inokawa/virtua — see `VList` API, `reverse` prop, `data` prop, slot syntax

  **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] `bun add virtua` completed, `virtua` in `packages/desktop/package.json` dependencies
  - [ ] `bun run check` passes (monorepo root) and `bun run --cwd packages/desktop typecheck` passes

## Final Verification Wave (MANDATORY — after ALL implementation tasks)

> 4 review agents run in PARALLEL. ALL must APPROVE. Present consolidated results to user and get explicit "okay" before completing.
>
> **Do NOT auto-proceed after verification. Wait for user's explicit approval before marking work complete.**

- [x] F1. **Plan Compliance Audit** — `oracle`
    Read this plan end-to-end. For each "Must Have": verify implementation exists (read file, run command). For each "Must NOT Have": search codebase for forbidden patterns — reject with file:line if found. Verify evidence files exist: `.sisyphus/evidence/memory-baseline.txt` and `.sisyphus/evidence/memory-after.txt`. Check deliverables list.
    Output: `Must Have [N/N] | Must NOT Have [N/N] | Tasks [N/N] | VERDICT: APPROVE/REJECT`

- [x] F2. **Code Quality Review** — `unspecified-high`
    Run `bun run check` from monorepo root (typecheck + lint + format across all packages). Also run `bun run --cwd packages/desktop typecheck` specifically for vue-tsc. Run `bun test tests/` from `packages/desktop`. Review all changed files for: `as any`/`@ts-ignore`, empty catches, console.log in prod code, commented-out code, unused imports. Check AI slop: excessive comments, over-abstraction, generic variable names.
    Output: `Build [PASS/FAIL] | Lint [PASS/FAIL] | Tests [N pass/N fail] | VERDICT`

- [x] F3. **Real Manual QA** — `unspecified-high`
    Use the dev HTTP endpoint and `seed-chat.ts` fixture from Task 7 for message injection: 1. Start app: `bun run --cwd packages/desktop dev` (starts Vite + bun/index.ts in parallel) 2. Wait 20 seconds for both processes to be ready 3. Run seed: `bun packages/desktop/tests/fixtures/seed-chat.ts` 4. Assert: seed exits 0 with "Injected 150 messages" 5. Verify dev endpoint responds: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X POST http://localhost:45824/dev/inject-chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"f3-test",...}'` → Assert 200

    Verify all code-based QA scenarios from Tasks 5–7 via grep:
    - grep for no .reverse() in ChatList
    - grep for `from 'virtua/vue'` in ChatList (virtua import)
    - grep for VList `:reverse` prop in ChatList (bottom-anchor scroll)
    - grep for no `reactive(new Map` in useMessageParsing.ts
    - grep for triggerRef in App.vue
    - grep for no local pollTimer/setInterval in ChatList (already done before this plan)

    Capture all evidence to `.sisyphus/evidence/final-qa/`.
    Output: `Code Verification [N/N pass] | Endpoint smoke [PASS/FAIL] | Seed injection [PASS/FAIL] | VERDICT`

- [x] F4. **Post-fix Measurement + CEF Baseline Documentation** — `quick`
    **Two-phase measurement** to cover both idle and loaded workload:

    **Phase 1 — Idle measurement** (same conditions as Task 1 baseline):
    1. Start app: `bun run --cwd packages/desktop dev` (starts Vite + bun/index.ts — same command as Task 1)
    2. Wait 30 seconds for stable idle state
    3. Get PID: `PID=$(pgrep TwirChat)` (fallback: `PID=$(pgrep -f "src/bun/index.ts" | tr '\n' ' ' | awk '{print $1}')`)
    4. Run:

```bash
echo "=== Post-fix Idle ===" > .sisyphus/evidence/memory-after.txt
echo "=== Date: $(date) ===" >> .sisyphus/evidence/memory-after.txt
grep VmRSS /proc/$PID/status >> .sisyphus/evidence/memory-after.txt
awk '/Private_Clean|Private_Dirty/{sum+=$2} END{print "Idle USS:", sum/1024, "MB"}' /proc/$PID/smaps >> .sisyphus/evidence/memory-after.txt
````

      **Phase 2 — Loaded measurement** (after seeding 150 messages to exercise renderer + adapters):
      1. Run seed: `bun packages/desktop/tests/fixtures/seed-chat.ts`
      2. Wait 30 seconds for messages to settle
      3. Get updated PID if needed: `PID=$(pgrep TwirChat)`
      4. Run:

```bash
echo "=== Post-fix Loaded (150 messages) ===" >> .sisyphus/evidence/memory-after.txt
grep VmRSS /proc/$PID/status >> .sisyphus/evidence/memory-after.txt
awk '/Private_Clean|Private_Dirty/{sum+=$2} END{print "Loaded USS:", sum/1024, "MB"}' /proc/$PID/smaps >> .sisyphus/evidence/memory-after.txt

The actual app-private memory is the USS figure above. These shared pages cannot be reduced without changing the rendering engine. CEF is configured in packages/desktop/electrobun.config.ts (bundleCEF: true, defaultRenderer: 'cef')."
      Output: `Baseline Idle USS: X MB → Post-fix Idle USS: Y MB → Post-fix Loaded USS: Z MB | VERDICT`

## Commit Strategy

```
commit 1: (baseline measurement — no code, evidence file only)
commit 2: fix(youtube-adapter): clear reconnectTimeout before scheduling new one
commit 3: fix(kick-adapter): close existing WebSocket before creating new connection
commit 4: fix(twitch-adapter): guard connectChatClient against double-connect
commit 5: perf(message-parsing): remove reactive() from mentionColorCache, add 2000-entry cap
commit 6: perf(app): eliminate O(n) spread allocation on every incoming message
commit 7: feat(chat-list): add virtua VList for DOM virtualization
```

Each commit boundary: `bun run fix` (monorepo root) + `bun run --cwd packages/desktop typecheck` passes + `bun test tests/` passes, app runnable.

## Success Criteria

### Verification Commands

```bash
# From monorepo root:
bun run check                                    # Expected: no errors
bun run --cwd packages/desktop typecheck         # Expected: vue-tsc no errors
bun test --cwd packages/desktop tests/           # Expected: all tests pass

# Start app correctly (Vite + bun process in parallel):
bun run --cwd packages/desktop dev

# Memory — idle (same as baseline, after 30s):
PID=$(pgrep TwirChat)
awk '/Private_Clean|Private_Dirty/{sum+=$2} END{print sum/1024, "MB USS idle"}' /proc/$PID/smaps

# Memory — loaded (after running seed-chat.ts + 30s):
bun packages/desktop/tests/fixtures/seed-chat.ts
sleep 30
PID=$(pgrep TwirChat)
awk '/Private_Clean|Private_Dirty/{sum+=$2} END{print sum/1024, "MB USS loaded"}' /proc/$PID/smaps
# Expected: loaded USS measurably close to or lower than baseline USS

# Virtua integration check:
grep "from 'virtua/vue'" packages/desktop/src/views/main/components/ChatList.vue
grep "VList" packages/desktop/src/views/main/components/ChatList.vue
# Expected: both return results

# mentionColorCache fix check:
grep "reactive.*mentionColorCache" packages/desktop/src/views/main/composables/useMessageParsing.ts
# Expected: no output (reactive() removed)

# Dev endpoint smoke test (app must be running):
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X POST http://localhost:45824/dev/inject-chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"check-1","platform":"twitch","channel":"t","channelId":"c","username":"u","displayName":"U","text":"hi","timestamp":0,"badges":[],"emotes":[],"color":"#fff"}'
# Expected: 200
```
